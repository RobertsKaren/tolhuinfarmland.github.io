[^1]: "*According to estimates compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), by 2050 we will need to produce 60 per cent more food to feed a world population of 9.3 billion. Doing that with a farming-as-usual approach would take too heavy a toll on our natural resources. Thus, we have no choice but to embark on a greener revolution.*" ¨[UN](https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/feeding-world-sustainably#:~:text=According%20to%20estimates%20compiled%20by,toll%20on%20our%20natural%20resources.)
